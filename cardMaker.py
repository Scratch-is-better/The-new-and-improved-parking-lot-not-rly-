'''
The below code is a mixture of the client.py and following the below tutorial to deal with the RFID
https://www.circuitbasics.com/what-is-an-rfid-reader-writer/

Hints:
* You should be able to just use this script as a helper to sign up a couple of cards for you to use on the bank server
* My implementation writes the pin to the card, if you want more security, don't do this and make user type in PIN after tapping card on the bank transfer
* For payment: you can grab both the ID and pin off the card in one line by: id, pin = reader.read()
* I haven't tested making a payment, but how hard could it be... ðŸ˜Ž
